# ArduinoOS
This is and OS for arduino. The OS IS NOT WRITTEN IN C++. Thus you dont have to worry about using and/ or learning C++ to change any part of this OS to your liking.  In order to use the OS, you need:

Arduino (Arduino Mega recommended),
Nextion Display, MicroSD card, and
Nextion HMI (for editing). 

IN CASE YOU DO NOT HAVE AN ARDUINO!
You only need to have a stable power supply for the NExtion Display. Most likely included in the Nextion box.

# How to Install OS
put your microSD card in you PC/laptop. Now, open gitBash and run "git clone https://github.com/RangerDevv/ArduinoOS.git". Onece done cloning locate the file.  Now, try to locate the file named ArduinoOS in you computer. Once located, copy the tft file and paste it into the microSD card. Finally, eject the SD card and put it into the nextion display. once its done copying from the SD card, remove the SD card and restart the display... and voila! you have an OS in the display!

Thnaks for Using this OS!

Ranger.

# ArduinoOS
This is and OS for arduino. The OS IS NOT WRITTEN IN C++. Thus you dont have to worry about using and/ or learning C++ to change any part of this OS to your liking.  In order to use the OS, you need:

Arduino (Arduino Mega recommended),
Nextion Display, and
Nextion HMI (for editing). 

IN CASE YOU DO NOT HAVE AN ARDUINO!
You only need to have a stable power supply for the NExtion Display. Most likely included in the Nextion box.


Thnaks for Using this OS!
